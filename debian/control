Description: Debian package upload tool
 DPut is the Debian Package Upload Tool. The ‘dput’ command uploads one or more
 packages to the Debian archive.
 .
 This package also includes the ‘dcut’ command, which can generate and / or
 upload a commands file for the Debian FTP archive upload queue.
 .
 ‘dput’ runs some tests to verify that the package is compliant with Debian
 Policy. It can also run Lintian on the package before upload, and/or run
 ‘dinstall’ in dry-run-mode, when using an appropriate upload method.
 .
 DPut is intended mainly for Debian maintainers, although it can also be useful
 for people maintaining local APT repositories.
